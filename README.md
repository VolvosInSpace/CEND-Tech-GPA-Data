During initial developments of the project we use tested multiple ways of completing the project.
  These included single file applications or mutltiple file applications
  After testing each option, the frontend/backend option seemed most fitting 
  This was then developed over the course of a month-ish into the final frontEnd.py and backEnd.py files
  If wanting to download and run the application you will have to download both frontEnd.py and backEnd.py and then navigate to your
    command prompt go the file directory where the files are located and run "python frontEnd.py" (python needing to be downloaded). This will load up the application using system python
    references. If wanting to make it into the .exe file, you will have to run pyinstaller, a quick google search and you will find some simple instructions on how to do this (will need the pyinstaller package).
